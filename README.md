# Week-Five-Lab
##Experiment with Zuul  

For this week I want you to play around with the Zuul game.  

Start with *Better-Zuul* and see if you can add the following features:

* Add a new room to the game in a new direction (up, down, etc)
* Add a new command to the game.  
	* Add a command to add a room.  
	* Add a command to destroy a room.
